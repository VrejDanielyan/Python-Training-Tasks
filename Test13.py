# 13. One line anonymous function to return given number's cube and print -
# all program should be in one line - given number is 5


#number = int(input("Number is: "))
cube = lambda number: number * number * number
print(cube(4))



# Another solution
'''def cube(x):
    return x * x * x
print(cube(5))'''
